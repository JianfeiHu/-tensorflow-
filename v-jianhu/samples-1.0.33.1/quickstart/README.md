## Welcome Azure Machine Learning service through Azure Notebooks

First try the example [01.run-experiment](01.run-experiment.ipynb) to connect to your workspace 
and run a basic experiment using Azure Machine Learning Python SDK, 
and then [02.deploy-web-service](02.deploy-web-service.ipynb) to deploy a model as a web service.

Then move to more comprehensive examples in **tutorials** folder.

 **Note:**
 The config.json file in this folder was created for you with details of your Azure Machine 
 Learning service workspace. Both these notebooks use this file to connect to your workspace. 
 You can also copy this file into other places where you have code that needs this connection.
